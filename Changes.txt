GedTools - Version History

1.5.1 - 3 August 2009
* Added a separate sorting algorithm for the number-type columns
  (e.g. ID, Birth Year and Death Year)

1.5.0 - 25 July 2009
* Fixed operator precedence-related logic error causing loops in
  GDateEstimator::estimateMissingDates() to exit too soon
* Altered GDateEstimator::findSiblingRefs() to use the birthYear
  property of the famHead rather than the headComplete since it
  might not yet be set at that point in the algorithm

1.4.0 - 19 July 2009
* Fixed GDateEstimator::updateIndividual() so that only blank places
  with a corresponding non-blank date will be filled during estimation
* Changed the end of line from "\n" to "\r\n" to match PAF's output

1.3.0 - 6 July 2009
* Fixed the GDateEstimator::estimateBranchBetween() algorithm so that
  all date projections are done relative to the eldest child
* Now all blank place values will be filled when estimating dates rather
  than just adding places for newly estimated dates

1.2.0 - 25 June 2009
* Support for dates in the B.C. era added
* Fixed bugs in GDateEstimator::estimateBranchBetween()
  and GDateEstimator::estimateSiblingsBetween() algorithms
