GedTools - Version History

1.11.0 - 14 May 2016
* Added option to choose whether or not to use adoptive relationships
  when estimating missing dates in a family tree.

1.10.0 - 7 March 2010
* Added option to choose whether or not to replace existing pinyin
  entries when using the Append Pinyin functionality.
* Updated the date estimation algorithm to fix an error.

1.9.0 - 7 September 2009
* Restructured several methods in GDateEstimator so that marriage dates
  will not be estimated as being after the first child's birth date.
* Altered estimation for marriage dates of individuals with multiple
  spouses to include a 5-year gap between marriages, and removed the code
  for simply making each wife 5 years younger than the previous.

1.8.4 - 31 August 2009
* Added two rare characters to the pinyin database.
* Fixed a bug in the search function of the TreeWindow for individuals
  whose spouses have multiple marriages.
* Fixed the updateMarriage() method so that marriages are not placed
  after the birth of the first child after using estimateBranchBetween().

1.8.0 - 23 August 2009
* Added support for parentless ("Unknown") families
* Fixed bug introduced in last version where generation projection birth
  years were set equal to the parents' marraige year (instead of +/- 1)

1.7.5 - 23 August 2009
* Altered the GDateEstimator::updateBranchProjection() method to work
  from the marriage date rather than parents' birth dates
* Added a "Record #" column to the TreeView, as well as functionality
  to find individuals in the tree using their record numbers

1.7.0 - 12 August 2009
* Altered the GFamily::parseMembers() method to parse all child nodes
  of the family, just in case nodes are not ordered exactly as outlined
  in the GEDCOM specification
* Added a "Report Bugs" option to the "Help" menu

1.6.0 - 7 August 2009
* Changed GDateEstimator to only insert PLACE nodes if the
  defaultPlace value is non-null and non-empty
* Fixed GIndiEntry and GFamily so that new PLACE nodes are properly
  appended to the GNode tree (now PACE data will be saved)
* Fixed GIndiEntry::parseDeath() to parse PLACE nodes

1.5.1 - 3 August 2009
* Added a separate sorting algorithm for the number-type columns
  (e.g. ID, Birth Year and Death Year)

1.5.0 - 25 July 2009
* Fixed operator precedence-related logic error causing loops in
  GDateEstimator::estimateMissingDates() to exit too soon
* Altered GDateEstimator::findSiblingRefs() to use the birthYear
  property of the famHead rather than the headComplete since it
  might not yet be set at that point in the algorithm

1.4.0 - 19 July 2009
* Fixed GDateEstimator::updateIndividual() so that only blank places
  with a corresponding non-blank date will be filled during estimation
* Changed the end of line from "\n" to "\r\n" to match PAF's output

1.3.0 - 6 July 2009
* Fixed the GDateEstimator::estimateBranchBetween() algorithm so that
  all date projections are done relative to the eldest child
* Now all blank place values will be filled when estimating dates rather
  than just adding places for newly estimated dates

1.2.0 - 25 June 2009
* Support for dates in the B.C. era added
* Fixed bugs in GDateEstimator::estimateBranchBetween()
  and GDateEstimator::estimateSiblingsBetween() algorithms

1.1.0 - 23 June 2009
* Automatic update checks added

1.0.9 - 29 May 2009
* Algorithms added to estimate missing dates in the database

1.0.5 - 3 May 2009
* Interface added to view individuals in a tree format

1.0.0 - 23 March 2009
* Support for appending Hanyu Pinyin data to the ROMN field
