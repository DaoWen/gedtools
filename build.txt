GedTools was built using Qt by Nokia v4.5.2 (OpenSource)

To build this project you need to run qmake first:

qmake -makefile -o Makefile GedTools.pro

Qt adds certain macros and other things to their objects,
so you have to run them through the moc tool before compiling.
The qmake tool will automatically generate a makefile with all
the proper dependencies, and will even run the moc utility for
you, so it's really quite nice! After the makefiles have been
generated then just run make.
